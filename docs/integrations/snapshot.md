# Snapshot

## Auto Setup
Nance can publish proposals to your Snapshot space. The easiest way to set this up is during space creation:

![Snapshot space creation](/img/connect-snapshot.png)

Search for your Snapshot space and click `Add Nance as author`. Note: you must be the owner or moderator of the Snapshot space
to add Nance as an author.

This will prompt you to sign a transaction that modifies your space settings, adding Nance as an author and sending
the changes to the Snapshot API.

The address that Nance uses to author posts is `0x50e70c43a5dd812e2309eacea61348041011b4ba` aka `gnance.eth`
