# Discuss

Once a proposal is published, Nance creates a thread or forum post in your discussion platform of choice (currently supports Discord, more coming soon). This allows other organization members to discuss the proposal and provide feedback to the author. As feedback is provided, the author can refine their proposal accordingly.

As edits are made, Nance will update the proposal content in the discussion platform. This allows organization members to see the differences between versions of the proposal.
