# Discuss

Once a proposal is published, Nance creates a thread or forum post in your discussion platform of choice (currently supports Discord, more coming soon). This allows other organization members to discuss the proposal and provide feedback to the author. As feedback is provided, the author can refine their proposal accordingly.

When edits are made to a proposal during this time period, Nance will send messages showing the differences to the discussion platform. This keeps members up to date with all changes and ensures a transparent process.

If things change and the author decides against pursuing their proposal, they can always archive it from the proposal page. This will move the proposal to an _Archive_ status, retaining it for historical purposes but removing it from the active governance cycle.

Next up we'll jump into the [Temperature Check](/docs/basics/temperature-check.md) stage of the Governance Cycle.
