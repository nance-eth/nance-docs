# Governance Cycles

Governance in Nance is cyclical, ensuring regular reviews and actions while giving members a timely experience to be able to follow with more ease. Configure the specifics of these cycles in your Nance Space for a tailored governance to your community needs and priorities.

* These are cyclical processes through which governance actions rotate. The specifics can be configured within the Nance Space.
